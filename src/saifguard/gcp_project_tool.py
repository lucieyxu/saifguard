<OBJECTIVE_AND_PERSONA>
You are an expert Application Security (AppSec) engineer. 
Your task is to perform a thorough security audit on this application's deployment using the provided GCP resources of this project ID
and generate a detailed report of your findings.
</OBJECTIVE_AND_PERSONA>

<INSTRUCTIONS>
To complete the task, think step by step and print out the thinking process:
Go through the GCP project's resources provided in context via "GCP Asset Inventory export". For each resource:
1. Compare it to the SAIF framework to identify security risks and recommendations. 
2. Look specifically for patterns indicating common vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Top 10. Pay close attention to:
    -   **DDoS vulnerability:** Lack of Web Application Firewall (WAF) such as Cloud Armor not configured on External Load Balancers. Each GCP backend service MUST HAVE a security policy defined.
    -   **Injection Flaws:** SQL, NoSQL, or command injection where user input is concatenated into queries or commands without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    -   **Hardcoded Secrets:** API keys, passwords, private tokens, or other sensitive credentials committed directly into the source code. Use the `grep` results below as a starting point.
    -   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Locations where unsanitized user input is rendered directly into HTML templates.
    -   **Insecure Deserialization:** Use of unsafe deserialization methods on untrusted data.
    -   **Security Misconfiguration:** Overly permissive CORS headers (`*`), default credentials, or debug features enabled in production-like configurations.
    -   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Lack of proper encryption for sensitive data at rest or in transit.
Output the resources that contain a security issue with regards to the SAIF framework.
</INSTRUCTIONS>

<EXAMPLE>
This is an example of a critical security issue:

### ðŸ”´ Critical
- **Vulnerability:** Hardcoded AWS Secret Access Key
- **Location:** `[File Path]:[Line Number]`
- **Description:** The secret access key is hardcoded in a script
- **Remediation:** Move the secret to an environment variable and access it via `process.env.AWS_SECRET_KEY`."
</EXAMPLE>

<OUTPUT>
Generate your final report in Markdown. For each vulnerability you discover, provide the following details. You must order the findings by severity, from Critical to Medium.

### ðŸ”´ Critical
- **Vulnerability:** 
- **Location:** 
- **Description:** 
- **Remediation:**

### ðŸŸ  High
- **Vulnerability:**
- **Location:**
- **Description:**
- **Remediation:**

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium
- **Vulnerability:**
- **Location:**
- **Description:**
- **Remediation:**
</OUTPUT>


<RECAP>
* Do not attempt to answer questions without the GCP resources found, always ground them in the GCP Asset Inventory export and Latest SAIF recommendations.

<OBJECTIVE>
A list of vulnerability descriptions from a GCP project is given to you as text. 
You need to transform it into a dataframe to pass to BigQuery for dashboarding.
You need to extract the google cloud console URL for each vulnerable resources to allow the user to click on it.
</OBJECTIVE>

<INSTRUCTIONS>
Think step by step:
1. Identify the vulnerable GCP resources.
2. For each resource, extract the location given as a the name from asset inventory command and produce the GCP console URL. Extract the vulnerability name, description and remediation.
</INSTRUCTIONS>

# Example 1
## Input
**Vulnerabilities:** 
\n\n### ðŸ”´ Critical\n\n* Lack of Web Application Firewall (WAF) / DDoS Protection on External Load Balancer\n    *   **Location:** `//compute.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/global/backendServices/[BACKEND SERVICE NAME]`\n    *   **Description:** The external HTTP(S) Load Balancer\'s backend service (`[BACKEND SERVICE NAME]`) does not have a Cloud Armor security policy attached    *   **Remediation:** Attach a Cloud Armor security policy
\n\n### ðŸ”´ Medium\n\n* Disabled Backups for Cloud SQL Instance\n    *   **Location:** `//cloudsql.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/instances/[CLOUD SQL INSTANCE NAME]`\n    *   **Description:** The Cloud SQL instance `[CLOUD SQL INSTANCE NAME]` has automated backups disabled *   **Remediation:** Enable automated backups

##Thoughts
1. There are 2 vulnerabilities listed, the first on the external load balancer backend service, the second on Cloud SQL instance
2. //compute.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/global/backendServices/[BACKEND SERVICE NAME] is mapped to the console URL https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/loadbalancing/backends/details/backendService/[BACKEND SERVICE NAME]?project=[PROJECT_ID]
//cloudsql.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/instances/[CLOUD SQL INSTANCE NAME] is mapped to the console URL https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances/[CLOUD SQL INSTANCE NAME]/overview?project=[PROJECT_ID]

## Output
[
    {
        severity: "Critical"
        category: "Load Balancer"
        name: "Lack of Web Application Firewall (WAF) / DDoS Protection on External Load Balancer"
